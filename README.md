# How-to-load-items-in-WPF-HierarchyNavigator-Breadcrumb-control-in-on-demand-
This repository provides a practical example demonstrating how to load items in the WPF HierarchyNavigator (Breadcrumb) control on-demand using Syncfusion's WPF controls. The HierarchyNavigator is a powerful UI component that allows users to navigate hierarchical data structures efficiently, similar to a breadcrumb navigation system.
In many real-world applications, loading all hierarchical data at once can be inefficient or unnecessary. This sample shows how to optimize performance by loading items dynamically as the user interacts with the control. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when data retrieval involves expensive operations such as database queries or API calls.
The implementation leverages Syncfusionâ€™s flexible architecture to define custom logic for loading child items only when needed. This not only improves application responsiveness but also reduces memory usage.
For detailed guidance, refer to the Syncfusion Knowledge Base article:

This example is ideal for developers looking to enhance the performance and scalability of WPF applications using Syncfusion controls.
